    "### Learning Goals\n",
    "- I can clearly state the purpose of a data analysis solution.\n",
    "- I can describe use cases that outline how the data analysis solution will be used.\n",
    "- I can develop test cases that include inputs and expected outputs for the data analysis solution.\n",
    "- I can specify non-functional requirements such as performance, scalability, security, and usability for a data analysis solution.\n",
    "- I can explain the importance of non-functional requirements in ensuring the overall quality and effectiveness of a data analysis solution.\n",
    "### Non-Functional Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data \n",
    "Data: I am going to analyse fish seafood production from all of the countries from 1961 to 2021.\n",
    "Goal: My goal is to find out how much seafood has been harvested since 1961, which countries harvested the most while it also being able to sort data.\n",
    "Source: The source is from “RamLegacy”,  a non-profit organisation whose data is primarily focused on commercially exploited marine populations worldwide.\n",
    "Access: The data is publicly avaible at https://ourworldindata.org/fish-and-overfishing.\n",
    "Access Method:The data is accessable from it's preview or you can download it as csv.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functional Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Loading: I must be able to deal with errors in loading data and sort problemsm like incorrect format, missing files.\n",
    "Data Cleaning: The progam must be able to handle any missing values while also being able to filter, sort and group specific data like by date, name and values. \n",
    "Data Analysis: The application can also find the mean, median, mode, and quartiles. \n",
    "Data Visualisation: The data can be visualised in diffrent types charts like bar charts and line charts.\n",
    "Data Reporting: The final output can be exported as an csv filel. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "It is recommended that you use the following template to do this:\n",
    "Function Name (e.g. Data Loading)\n",
    "Description: It must be able to effectivly anaylise the data, isolate data - e.g. by date or country, and give the mean ect.\n",
    "Input: The user can give basic commands like for example \"Isolate China\".\n",
    "Output: sort out china and output china's stastistics\n",
    "Use Cases\n",
    "Use cases essentially describe how users will interact with the system by providing an example of how it will work. The following example demonstrates how you create a use-case and the template should be used to create a use-case for each functional requirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Actor: User\n",
    "Goal: Isolate china\n",
    "Preconditions: User has a dataset file ready.\n",
    "Main Flow: \"Isolate china\"\n",
    "User places the dataset for reading into the correct folder.\n",
    "System validates the file format.\n",
    "System loads the dataset and displays the information in a dataframe.\n",
    "Postconditions: Dataset is loaded and ready for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-Functional Requirements\n",
    "Typically non-functional requirements would focus on performance, usability, reliability, scalability and security. However, for this task we are going to focus on usability and reliability, as the performance and scalability will not vary much due to only working with one or two datasets and security was a bit much to cram into the short time we have to complete the task. You are of course welcome to add a security layer (e.g. username + password) to your UI if you feel it's appropriate, and if you have time.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, focus on the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "Usability: What is required from the User Interface and a 'README' document?\n",
    "\n",
    "Reliability: What is required from the system when providing information to the user on errors and ensuring data integrity?\n"

    "Let's do a deep dive of the issue to further understand and explain why this data analysis needs to be carried out by exploring what is lacking about current information. Make sure to link any references.\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: The purpose is to analyze data about tonnes of seafood harvest per country, finding the mean, average and patterns in the data, and how declining fish stocks is affecting the harvest rate\n",
    "Missing Data: I believe that it is necessary to analyze this data as the oceans and fish stocks are in trouble with fish stocks declining. This analysis will give new information and proof why you have to act now. \n",

These companies have an obligation to protect the user and my job is to provide safe and easy to use data.\n",
